    <h1>Chocolate Banana Muffin recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These chocolate banana muffins are so moist and full of flavor! I have looked at dozens of 
    recipes and most had too much sugar for my liking. There is absolutely no need for a lot of 
    sugar to make these muffins delicious. Because they have bananas and chocolate chips, I just 
    added 1/2 cup of sugar, which turned out perfect!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large very ripe bananas, mashed</li>

    </ul>
